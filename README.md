# WPR

In each trial, the procedure shows:
1) an NxN matrix with images or text.
2) mask
3) First matrix, with or without one element changed
4) The participant has to decide if anything was changed.

The procedure wasn't used in any experiment, so it wasn't tested or verified. The option with a dot, which indicates to the participant which element has been changed, does not work.Â
